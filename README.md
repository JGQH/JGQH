### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am **Juan Quispe**, a self-taught Front-End developer (Although I have some projects not related to it).

My main skills are **React JS**, **Next JS**, and a bit of **Mongo DB** (With *Node Driver*, not *Mongoose*). Other skills are **SCSS** and **TypeScript**.

I also use **Supabase** for serverless applications, which you're currently seeing in my stats cards below!

</p>

##### This card was generated via [github-readme-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats), but the parameters were taken from my Supabase database managed by my own CMS, [check it out!](https://github.com/JGQH/jgqh-cms)

##### If you want to fork the CMS to use it yourself, do it! No worries!

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am **Juan Quispe**, a self-taught Front-End developer (Although I have some projects not related to it).

My main skills is are **React JS**, **Next JS**, and a bit of Mongo DB (Native driver, not Mongoose)

I also use **Supabase** for serverless applications, which you're currently seeing in my stats cards below!

##### This card was generated via ![github-readme-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats), but the parameters were taken from my Supabase database managed by my own CMS, [check it out!](https://github.com/JGQH/jgqh-cms) If you want to fork it, do it! No worries!
